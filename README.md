# Quadrotor Aerobatics - Aggressive Trajectory Control

INDI (Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion) controller implementation for aggressive quadrotor maneuvers using differential flatness.

## Features
- Minimum-snap trajectory generation
- INDI-based attitude control
- Aerobatic maneuver primitives (loops, flips)
- 6-DOF simulation in NED frame

## Quick Start
```matlab
run demo_mission_1.m
run demo_mission_2.m
run demo_mission_3.m
run demo_indi_6dof_ned.m
```

## Based on
- MIT ACL's aggressive flight controller
- Differential flatness theory
